When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository is useful for when multiple people are contributing to your project as well as having a backup of your files

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
That way you can decide when you're ready to test your changes against the latest code
