When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository is useful for when multiple people are contributing to your project as well as having a backup of your files

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
That way you can decide when you're ready to test your changes against the latest code

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks only work when copying a repository from one github accunt to another. Good for getting another user's repository to work on
Clones work with copying a repository from either GitHub or your computer to a directory in your computer. Good for when you want direct access to the original repository
Branches are good when trying to add new features

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
We can see what changes other users have made to our repository
