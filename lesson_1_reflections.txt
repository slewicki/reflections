How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
The diff simplified the process by going directly to the line that changed

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It's easier to see what changes were made and where so that if something breaks you can easily pinpoint the issue.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros would definetly be that you know that the code you made and tested works out well and that it doesn't break anything horribly
Cons are that your computer might experience an error and you can lose your work

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git was made with programming in mind. By being able to save multiple files at once you can continue working while keeping the application functionality intact.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
By using the log and diff commands you can see where changes took place and help pinpoint development errors

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something
Git makes it easier to revert back to a previous state

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to use git to start working and storeing projects
